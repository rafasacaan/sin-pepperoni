The fundamental problem\n\nThe `treamtment effect` or causal effect of the treatment on the outcome for unit $i$ is the difference between its two potential outcomes:\n\n$$\\text{treatment effect} = Y_{1i} - Y_{0i}$$\n\n\nThe problem is that for no individual we are going to observe both potential outcomes! One is always going to be counterfactual. This is the `fundamental problem of causal inference`, we can only observe $Y_{0}$ or $Y_{1}$.\n\n\\begin{align}\n    Y_{i} = \\left\\{\n    \\begin{array}{cl}\n    Y_{0i} & D_{i} = 0 \\\\\n    Y_{1i} & D_{i} = 1.\n    \\end{array}\n    \\right.\n\\end{align}\n\nBut, for this last statement to survive, we need to make some `strong assumptions`.\n\n- Potential outcomes for unit $i$ are unaffected by treatment of unit $j$\n- Rules out intereference across units\n\nAs this assumptions are problematic, we should `choose our units of analysis` in such way that interference is minimum.\n\n\nHaving defined the setup, we might be interested in estimating the following quantities:\n\n**Average treatment effect (ATE)**\n\n$\\alpha_{ATE} = E[Y_{1} - Y_{0}]$\n\n**Conditional Average treatment effect (CATE) or ATE on the treated (ATET)**\n\n$\\alpha_{CATE} = E[Y_{1} - Y_{0}| D = 1]$\n\n\n# 2. Regression replaces randomization!\n\nWe can´t always run RCT´s. Regression, on the counterside, are cheaper and faster. Yet, can regression really be causal?\n\n",
