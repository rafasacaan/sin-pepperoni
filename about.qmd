Hello, my name is Rafa, and this is the sin-pepperoni blog.

I started off as an electrical engineer, then deep-dived into math and optimization to tackle questions about electrical power systems, and eventually earned an MSc in operations research and data science.

Since then, I've been collaborating as a data scientist, putting questions at the heart of my work, and leveraging the toolbox I've gathered along my journey to answer them.

Feel free to connect and thank you for reading!
