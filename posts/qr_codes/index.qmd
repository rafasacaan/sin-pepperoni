QR codes can hold up to 7,089 characters

# I. Generate QR codes

LetÂ´s jump into it right away using the `qrcode[pil]` library.
```{python}
import qrcode
import matplotlib.pylab as plt

img = qrcode.make("""
It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
If'n you don't know by now
And it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
It'll never do somehow
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn
Look out your window and I'll be gone
You're the reason I'm a-traveling on
But don't think twice, it's all right"""
)

# Save as png
img.save("dylan_qr.png")

# Plot
plt.imshow(img);
```


The message can be decoded using `cv2` library.
```{python}
import cv2

# read the QRCODE image
img = cv2.imread("dylan_qr.png")

detector = cv2.QRCodeDetector()
data, bbox, straight_qrcode = detector.detectAndDecode(img)
```

The decoded message is:
```{python}
print(data)
```
